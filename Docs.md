## Understanding Architecture

1. When we click on "Pay now", the request goes to the HDFC bank server.

2. The bank server responds back with a token to the backend.

3. The Backend provides a url for the frontend to redirect to the bank's payment page.

4. The bank's payment page is shown to the user.

5. After user pays the amount, the bank redirects the user back to the frontend with a response.
